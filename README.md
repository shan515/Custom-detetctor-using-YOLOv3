* Custom yolov3 detector fo knife implemented on Google Colab. 

* This training was implemented on [Google colaboratory.](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) 
  
  

### Steps
* Clone [AlexyAB's darknet repo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). Or to get custom files placed accordingly clone my forked version on this [repo](https://github.com/shan515/darknet).  
* Clone this [Custom-detector-using-YOLOv3 repo.](https://github.com/shan515/Custom-detetctor-using-YOLOv3).  
* Use the prepare.py to generate train.txt and val.txt files required for providing paths at the time of training.  
* Upload this folder to your colab notebook.  
* Now follow the steps mentioned in the [colab notebook](https://github.com/shan515/Custom-detetctor-using-YOLOv3/blob/master/knife_yolo.ipynb) to get custom weights for your detector.
